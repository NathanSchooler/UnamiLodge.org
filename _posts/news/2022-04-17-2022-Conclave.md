## It’s Time to sign up for Conclave!

The 2022 Section-NE5 Conclave is just around the corner and registration is now open! This Year’s conclave will be hosted by Woapalanne Lodge 43 and the event will take place at Mt. Allamuchy Scout Reservation (MASR) on June 10-12. MASR is located on nearly 1,000 acres in Stanhope, NJ, in the Patriot’s Path Council. This year’s theme is A Torchlit Tomorrow, In Olympic fashion, Section NE-5 hopes to bank off of the spark that is already within each one of us, in bearing the burden of carrying the torch for the future of our organization!

As many of you know, Unami Lodge is striving to be the largest lodge in attendance for the 2nd year in a row, we can only do that if **you** sign up! Conclave is a section-wide event where all 11 lodges from our section come together and participate in trainings, activities, competitions, and fellowship. This is a great annual event you surely don’t want to miss. You can Sign up for Conclave at: [UnamiLodge.org/conclave](/conclave).
