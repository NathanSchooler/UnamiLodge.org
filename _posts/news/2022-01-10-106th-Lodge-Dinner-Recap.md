Thanks to everyone who joined us for this year's Annual Lodge Dinner! We greatly enjoyed meeting up with many of our friends, but we missed many of you as well. In the next week, we will be sharing some recordings from the dinner for a more immersive experience but until then, here are some details.

Some notable highlights of the dinner were:

- [Induction of the 2022 Officers](/officers/)
- Two recipients of the [Green Turtle Award](/history/awards/green-turtle)
- [4 Dave Fortunator OSA Recipients](/history/awards/adult-osa)
- [4 Tom Richards OSA Recipients](/history/awards/youth-osa)
- [4 Chuck Benshetler Spirit of Camp Leadership Award Recipients](/history/awards/camp-leadership)
- [3 Founder's Award Recipients](/history/awards/founders)

[Make sure to check out the photo album to see all of these and more!](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjzy5AJ)

Don't forget to [stay tuned for upcoming events](/calendar). The Community Service Day is quickly approaching and Unami Lodge is taking lead in providing volunteers for the council Pinewood Derby event April 2! If you plan on going to all of our weekends this year, there is still time to [sign up for a Turtle Power Pass](https://scoutingevent.com/525-22TP)!

YOU THINK THAT'S IT? THERE'S MORE! *but we're not quite ready to share it yet.* Make sure to stay tuned on social media this week and next or check back at this page for all of the updates!
