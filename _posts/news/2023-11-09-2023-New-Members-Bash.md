Hello newly inducted members to Unami Lodge, One!

Are you interested in learning more about how our lodge operates? Are you interested in attending another event? You are invited to join us for an evening of fellowship at Gravity Vault where you can participate in rock climbing and get to know our lodge! Interested in getting involved in a committee or your chapter but don't know what all the opportunities are? Lodge Officers and committee chairs will be there to meet you. This is a perfect chance to get a deeper understanding of how the lodge and committees work!

You're invited to come and learn a little bit more about how our lodge works!
