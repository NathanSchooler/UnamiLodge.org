**Join us for a fun night of trivia to benefit Unami Lodge, Oneâ€™s youth program!**
 
In July 2022, [Unami, One will be attending the National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC)](/noac) at The University of Tennessee. This fundraiser is to raise funds and reduce the normal cost for youth that want to attend. The trivia night fundraiser will be held on May 21, 2022 at [St. Catherine of Siena Church in Horsham, PA](https://goo.gl/maps/2BsrLfnybkJXB1927). Doors will open at 6:00 PM, and the cost of the event is $25.00 which includes snacks and a light dinner. Leave the kids at home for this wonderfully mind-twisting fellowship event; this event is BYOB! Trivia night is open to any and all adults 21 and over that wish to help contribute to this endeavor. **(Scouting involvement not required!)**
