## A Letter from The Chief Elect

Dear Unami Lodge,

I am so honored to be your next chief!  As stated in my speech, I am ready to take the next step in serving the lodge.  I want to congratulate all of the new officers.  For those that did win their elected position, I still want you to serve the lodge by being on the LEC.  We still need you!

Right now, I am at Fort Benning, Georgia attending Army Basic training.   I will be home in December to serve the lodge.  I want all members to know that I am committed to serving this lodge.  The officers and I have already started working to get out agenda up and running for the 23rd lodge year.

I will be honest and say that I miss the lodge and all the events.  And YES, I miss the hours of LEC discussions!!!  I will be home soon to enjoy you all and the lodge again.

Looking towards the future, I am looking to expand our lodge in membership, fellowship and building upon the bonds of brotherhood.  Arrowmen, I want you all to know that YOU belong in our lodge and just you being a part of the lodge, helps make it the great lodge that it is.  Let us bring back our bothers who have drifted away and bring them back to our lodge family.

We are a strong and powerful lodge, but we can always become stronger.

Yours in scouting, 

Liam Lynch  
2023 Lodge Chief
