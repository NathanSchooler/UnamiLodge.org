Everyone's favorite fall event is almost here at the renowned Resica Falls Scout Reservation! There's some work to do as we help clean up camp and prepare it for the winter season. Do not fret, there will be fun fellowship as well as this year's themes enter their final form: the *Modern Era*.

For those new, and those who forgot, this is also the weekend where we will look towards our future and decide next year's leaders as we hold elections for the 2022 Lodge Officers.

Bring an appetite for cheerful service, fellowship, and ballot casting! Questions, comments, or concerns? [Reach on out to us; we would love to talk!](/contact?recipient=communications)
