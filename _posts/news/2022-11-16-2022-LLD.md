In December, the Lodge Leadership Development (LLD) committee will be hosting Unami's annual LLD training. Discuss goal-setting for the upcoming year, learn more about your role in the lodge, participate in conversations with your fellow arrowmen about how to improve and continue our program, and more! Join us virtually on Friday, December 16th, for goals and vision training with the newly-elected lodge officers and then in-person at Camp Jarvis on Saturday, December 17th for a day full of training and fellowship. Registration link and exact times to be announced soon.
